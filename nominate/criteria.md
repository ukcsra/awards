## {{ page.title }}

In each nomination, we're looking for evidence that demonstrates how the person, network or team nominated has done some or all of the following:

- supported staff development
- provided more pastoral staff support
- changed service delivery to support LGBT people
- changed something in their department to support LGBT people
- changed the Civil Service more broadly
- provided wider community outreach

Each nomination will be marked by an independent panel, and each nomination will be given a score.

**You don't have to demonstrate evidence of all areas above to get into the Index you're nominated for.** Each component of the Index listed above is given equal weighting.

Points will be awards for **breadth of impact** (i.e. doing something in multiple categories) and for **depth of impact** (i.e. doing lots of things in one area).
