### Write clearly

Make sure you write clearly. Spell out acronyms and explain unusual or complex terminology. Don't assume the judging panel will know about your work. It might be helpful to use the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) technique when writing your answers.

### Write for a senior audience

A mixture of senior civil servant and LGBT sector leaders will be judging the nominations. Make sure your nomination can be easily understood by a senior audience who might not be familiar with your work.

### Time

This nomination will probably take around 15-30 minutes to complete. You must complete the nomination in one sitting: unfortunately this form doesn't save nominations until you click "Submit" at the end.
