# How the Index works

We're creating 4 indices:

1. **<a href="/awards/indices/lgbt-civil-servants/" title="Read more about the LGBT civil servants Index">LGBT Civil Servant Index</a>** will celebrate LGBT civil servants who are acting as role models in their organisation and making the Civil Service and wider world better for LGBT people
2. **<a href="/awards/indices/allies/" title="Read more about the Allies Index">Allies Index</a>** will celebrate individuals who aren't LGBT but who are making a difference to the lives of LGBT civil servants and LGBT citizens
3. **<a href="/awards/indices/networks/" title="Read more about the Networks Index">Networks Index</a>** will recognise the hard work of departmental LGBT networks
4. **<a href="/awards/indices/teams/" title="Read more about the Teams Index">Teams Index</a>** will recognise Civil Service teams who, through their work, are improving the lives of LGBT people in general

Each Index will be a rank ordered list of the best role models in the Civil Service; nominated by you, and ranked by an independent panel.
